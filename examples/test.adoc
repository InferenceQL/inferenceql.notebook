Welcome to the InferenceQL tutorial.

WARNING: This functionality is very alpha.

Here's a SQL query:

[,iql]
----
SELECT
  Apogee_km,
  Purpose
FROM satellites
----

A subset of SQL queries are also valid InferenceQL.

Now here's a similar query with some custom InferenceQL logic!

[,iql]
----
SELECT
  Apogee_km,
  Purpose,

  PROBABILITY OF Apogee_km
  UNDER satellites_model
  GIVEN Purpose
FROM satellites
----

A subset of SQL queries are also valid InferenceQL.

Now here's a similar query with some custom InferenceQL logic!

[,iql]
----
SELECT
  Apogee_km,
  Purpose,

  PROBABILITY OF Apogee_km
  UNDER satellites_model
  GIVEN Purpose
FROM satellites
----
